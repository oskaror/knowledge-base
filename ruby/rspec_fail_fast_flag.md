# RSpec fail fast flag
> The fail_fast option will cause RSpec to immediately stop running your specs and output the failure details whenever it fails for the first time, giving you a nice speed boost when trying to fix some spec fails.

```shell script
$ rspec spec --fail-fast
```

> The --fail-fast option was released as a part of RSpec 2.1.
